Who do you think hates traffic more - humans or self-driving cars? The position of nearby automobiles is a key question for autonomous vehicles ― and it's at the heart of our newest challenge.

Self-driving cars have come a long way in recent years, but they're still not flawless. Consumers and lawmakers remain wary of adoption, in part because of doubts about vehicles’ ability to accurately perceive objects in traffic.

Baidu's Robotics and Autonomous Driving Lab (RAL), along with Peking University, hopes to close the gap once and for all with this challenge. They’re providing Kagglers with more than 60,000 labeled 3D car instances from 5,277 real-world images, based on industry-grade CAD car models.

Your challenge: develop an algorithm to estimate the absolute pose of vehicles (6 degrees of freedom) from a single image in a real-world traffic environment.

Succeed and you'll help improve computer vision. That, in turn, will bring autonomous vehicles a big step closer to widespread adoption, so they can help reduce the environmental impact of our growing societies.
